The DriverPass system involved designing a system for a client that needed a platform to help students prepare for and pass their driving tests.  This system required features such as scheduling a driving lesson, accessing study materials, and tracking user progress.  During this project, I was required to gather and analyze the clientâ€™s requirements, which were then documented in a business requirements document.  I also created a systems design document, making certain that the system was both user-friendly and functional.  One aspect of this project that I am proud of is the ability to gather information from the client and translate that information into different UML diagrams such as use case diagrams, activity diagrams, sequence diagrams, and class diagrams.  These diagrams were helpful in communicating the systems functionality.  

This project has helped me understand the importance of thorough documentation and clear communication in systems design.  I plan on incorporating these methods of creating detailed diagrams with greater readability to serve as effective communication tools in future projects.
